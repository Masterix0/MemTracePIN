# Trace Analysis Tool

This tool analyzes memory access trace files generated by our custom Intel PIN tool.
It calculates the correlation between the time of first access, total accesses, and page table scan (PTS) scoring within specified time windows.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

## Compilation

To compile the project, use the provided `makefile`:

```sh
make
```

## Usage

To run the trace analysis tool, use the following command:

```sh
java -cp bin TraceAnalyzer <real_time_interval_ms> <real_time_run_ms> <tracing_run_ms> <trace_directory> <dram_percentage> <sub_interval_duration_ms>
```

## Arguments

- **`real_time_interval_ms`**: Size of the real-time interval window in milliseconds.
- **`real_time_run_ms`**: Total runtime of the real-time benchmark in milliseconds.
- **`tracing_run_ms`**: Total runtime of the tracing run in milliseconds.
- **`trace_directory`**: Directory where the trace files are located.
- **`dram_percentage`**: Percentage of total memory pages that are assumed to fit in DRAM in each interval.
- **`sub_interval_duration_ms`**: Duration of each sub-interval for page table scan (PTS) scoring in milliseconds.

## Example

```sh
java -cp bin TraceAnalyzer 3 12 25000 /path/to/trace/files 0.3 1
```

This command analyzes the trace with:
- An interval window of 3 milliseconds
- Real runtime of 12 milliseconds
- Trace runtime of 25000 milliseconds
- Trace files located in `../MyPinTool/sorted/`
- DRAM percentage of 30%
- Sub-interval duration of 10 milliseconds

## Cleaning Up

To clean the build artifacts, use:

```sh
make clean
```
