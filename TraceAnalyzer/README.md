# Trace Analysis Tool

This tool analyzes memory access trace files generated by our custom Intel PIN tool.
It calculates the correlation between the time of first access and total accesses within specified time windows.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK)

## Compilation

To compile the project, use the provided `makefile`:

```bash
make
```

## Usage

To run the trace analysis tool, use the following command:

```bash
java -cp bin TraceAnalyzer <real_time_interval_ms> <real_time_run_ms> <tracing_run_ms> <trace_directory> <dram_percentage>
```

## Arguments:

 - **`real_time_interval_ms`**: Size of the real-time interval window in milliseconds.
 - **`real_time_run_ms`**: Total runtime of the real-time benchmark in milliseconds.
 - **`tracing_run_ms`**: Total runtime of the tracing run in milliseconds.
 - **`trace_directory`**: Directory where the trace files are located.
 - **`dram_percentage`**: Percentage of total memory pages that are assumed to fit in DRAM in each interval.

## Example

```bash
java -cp bin TraceAnalyzer 2 12 22750 /path/to/trace/files/
```

## Cleaning Up

To clean the build artifacts, use:

```bash
make clean
```
